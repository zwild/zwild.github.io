      <description>Introduction Breeze is a numerical processing library for Scala. It&#39;s a great tool for data science and machine learning. It&#39;s also used by Spark.
Visualization is important for data science and machine learning. Breeze provide breeze-viz for this. However it has only 4 kinds of plots -- line, scatter, histogram and image.
plotly-scala is the Scala bindings for plotly.js. It support a few of plots provided by plotly.

      <description>Introduction ob-ipython is &#34;an Emacs library that allows Org mode to evaluate code blocks using a Jupyter kernel (Python by default).&#34;
It&#39;s a great tool for you to make note and literal programming. It&#39;s easy to use comparing with ein. And you can make a matplot inline image in the org file comparing with ob-python.
Problem However it&#39;s not working properly when using a virtual environment.
When you don&#39;t have a system level jupyter installed and use org-mode, you will get a strange error like below.</description>

      <description>Why Emacs Emacs need years to get familiar with. But I think it&#39;s worth it. When you are familiar with it, you can customize it as you want, you can write whatever you want in your mind in a few of elisp codes. And there are also tons of libaries available.
F# is a great language. The fsharp-mode is full featured, and here is an introduction and some enhancement.
How Install We use fsharp-mode for code highlight, completion, flycheck and mainly everything.</description>
